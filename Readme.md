# Data Structures @ UNICAMP subject

This repository contains a collection of programming projects developed during a **Data Structures** course at the **University of Campinas (UNICAMP)**.

Each project addresses a real-world–inspired problem where selecting and implementing the appropriate data structure was essential to an efficient solution.

All projects were implemented in **C**, with a strong focus on algorithmic reasoning, efficiency, and proper use of abstract data types.

## 📚 Course Context

Throughout the semester, different fundamental data structures were studied. For each topic, a practical problem was proposed, requiring:

- Analysis of the problem constraints  
- Selection of the most appropriate data structure  
- Manual implementation of the structure (without external libraries)  
- Application of the structure to solve the given problem  

The goal of these assignments was not only to implement data structures, but also to understand **when and why** each one should be used.

## 🧱 Covered Data Structures

The repository includes implementations and applications of structures such as:

- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (e.g., Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)  
- Hash Tables  
- Graphs  
- Heaps / Priority Queues  

Each project focuses on one main structure, although auxiliary structures may also appear when necessary.

## 🔍 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of **fundamental data structures**
- Ability to **trasnlate real-world problems into computational solutions**
- Hands-on experience with **C programming and manual memory management**
- Clean, modular, and readable code
- Experience working under **academic constraints and specifications**

## 📁 Project Structure

Each directory corresponds to an individual project and typically includes:

- `.c` and `.h` source files  
- Problem description and constraints  
- Implementation of the required data structure  
- Input/output handling logic  

Projects are self-contained and can be compiled independently.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The implementations were developed for **academic purposes**.
- Code clarity and correctness were prioritized over extreme optimization.
- Some projects may reflect constraints imposed by the course specification.
