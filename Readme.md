# Data Structures - Unicamp

This repository contains a collection of programming projects developed during a **Data Structures** course (MC202) at the **University of Campinas (UNICAMP)**.

Each project addresses a real-world–inspired problem where selecting and implementing the appropriate data structure was essential to an efficient solution.

All projects were implemented in **C**, with a strong focus on algorithmic reasoning, efficiency, and proper use of abstract data types.

## 📚 Covered Data Structures

This repository includes implementations and applications of structures such as:

- Heaps / Priority Queues  
- Graphs
  
Each project focuses on one main structure, although auxiliary structures may also appear when necessary.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Paradigm:** Procedural programming  
- **Memory Management:** Manual (`malloc` / `free`)
- **Environment:** Linux

---

## 🔍 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of **fundamental data structures**
- Ability to **translate real-world problems into computational solutions**
- Hands-on experience with **C programming and manual memory management**
- Clean, modular, and readable code
- Experience working under **academic constraints and specifications**

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each directory corresponds to an individual project and typically includes:

- `.c` and `.h` source files  
- Problem description and constraints  
- Implementation of the required data structure  
- Input/output handling logic  

Projects are self-contained and can be compiled independently.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The implementations were developed for **academic purposes**.
- Code clarity and correctness were prioritized over extreme optimization.
- Some projects may reflect constraints imposed by the course specification.
